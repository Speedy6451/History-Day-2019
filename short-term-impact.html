        The loss of the sixth army and the fourth panzer army had a large impact on the southern front of the USSR. The battle had severely weakened the Axis and the Soviets decided to take advantage of that weakness. Operation Little Saturn was a Soviet Operation to push the Axis away from Stalingrad which succesfully pushed the axis back to Crimea and past Kharkov and Kursk where one of the last major axis offensives would take place.
