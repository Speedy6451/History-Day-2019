      Stalin would not evacuate Stalingrad because he thought that the soldiers fighting there would fight harder if there were more lives at risk. By August the German sixth and forth armies had met at the city. The axis flank was weakening as the armies desperately fought for control of the city. By mid September the Red army only had a small piece of the city which had to be supplied with boats through the Volga. In mid-October the advancing forces were so close to the river that the boats that supplied the Red Army were getting shot at. Then, in late August the red army launched its counteroffensive led by Goergy Zhukov, two attacks 50 miles North and South of the city on the weakened flanks and by November 23rd the two spearheads had met at Kalach, completing the encirclement. Instead of trying to break the armies out of Stalingrad, Hitler ordered Paulus to stay in Stalingrad and said that the armies would be supplied by the luftwaffe, something that it couldn't do.
