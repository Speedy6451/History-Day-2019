			  In 1941 The European Axis controlled most of Europe and the German high command was confident they had already easily overrun France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. Constant victories like this made the German high command confident that the Axis could defeat the Soviet Union 6 weeks after the start of the invasion, they thought, what can the country that lost to Finland do to the Axis? On June 22nd, 1941 the European Axis invaded the soviets and caught the red army completely off guard, making encirclement after encirclement. By the end of 1941 the axis had killed five million soviet soldiers, and now the soviets had their backs to Moscow. The Axis offensive had been halted due to lack of winter clothing that was a problem the German high command didnâ€™t think they would run into because they planned for a six week invasion starting in June.
